# Agrypnos
A Slay the Spire mod. It has a Florist.




A lot of assets are from https://github.com/Gremious/StS-DefaultModBase

I need to work on that.
Also, no cards have their own images.


Progress to completion:
52/~80 cards? maybe more, maybe less.
3/x relics - Probably going to aim for just a few more character relics
